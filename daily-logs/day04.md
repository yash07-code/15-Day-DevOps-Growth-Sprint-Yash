🚀 Day 4 of my 30-Day DevOps Growth Sprint – Getting Hands-On with Kubernetes Core Concepts :
Today was all about building a solid foundation in Kubernetes (K8s) – the powerhouse behind modern container orchestration. I didn't just read—I applied it.
📚 What I Explored:
1.Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Learned how containers live inside them.
2.ReplicaSets: Ensured my app always stays available with desired replicas—even if pods crash.
3. Deployments: Managed app versions smoothly using declarative updates.
4. Services: Exposed my apps using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer—understood how networking in K8s works.
5 Namespaces: Organized resources better—especially useful in multi-team or multi-env setups.

 What I Practiced:
Wrote and applied multiple YAML manifests
Created and scaled Deployments
Rolled out updates and performed rollbacks
Set up Services to expose my apps
Switched between namespaces for clean resource management

🔥 Bonus Learning:
 Deep-dived into kubectl explain, describe, and get commands for real-time insights into resource behavior.

💡 Kubernetes isn't just a buzzword—it’s a battlefield. Mastering these core building blocks is what sets a DevOps warrior apart.
