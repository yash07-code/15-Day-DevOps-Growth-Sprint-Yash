Day 4 of my 15-Day DevOps Growth Sprint – Getting Hands-On with Kubernetes Core Concepts :
Today was all about building a solid foundation in Kubernetes (K8s) – the powerhouse behind modern container orchestration. I didn't just read—I applied it.

What I Explored:
1.Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Learned how containers live inside them.
2.ReplicaSets: Ensured my app always stays available with desired replicas—even if pods crash.
3. Deployments: Managed app versions smoothly using declarative updates.
4. Services: Exposed my apps using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer—understood how networking in K8s works.
5 Namespaces: Organized resources better—especially useful in multi-team or multi-env setups.

 What I Practiced:
Wrote and applied multiple YAML manifests
Created and scaled Deployments
Rolled out updates and performed rollbacks
Set up Services to expose my apps
Switched between namespaces for clean resource management

 Bonus Learning:
 Deep-dived into kubectl explain, describe, and get commands for real-time insights into resource behavior.

 Kubernetes isn't just a buzzword—it’s a battlefield. Mastering these core building blocks is what sets a DevOps warrior apart.
