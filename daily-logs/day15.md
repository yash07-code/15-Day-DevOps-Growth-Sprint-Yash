Day 15/15 – DevOps Challenge COMPLETE!
After 15 days of focused learning, hands-on practice, and deep exploration of real-world DevOps tools — I’ve officially completed my 
hashtag#15DayDevOpsChallenge! 
Here’s what I’ve learned and implemented:
✅ CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
 → Built pipelines from scratch with Freestyle & Declarative
 → Integrated Trivy, SonarQube, and OWASP for security & quality
 → Automated container builds and Docker image pushes
✅ GitOps with ArgoCD
 → Deployed apps using Git-based sync
 → Automated rollback & health checks
 → Managed real-time Kubernetes deployments
✅ Kubernetes with AWS EKS
 → Provisioned EKS clusters using eksctl
 → Deployed 2-tier & 3-tier apps with manifests
 → Managed scaling, IAM roles, and networking
✅ Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
 → Visualized metrics, created dashboards
 → Setup alert rules and email notifications
 → Ensured cluster health, CPU, memory tracking
✅ AI + DevOps Exploration
 → Integrated n8n with Jenkins for pipeline failure alerts
 → Used OpenAI to explain build errors in human-friendly language
 → Sent real-time alerts via WhatsApp/Telegram

   Key Takeaways:
🔹 Consistency > Motivation
 🔹 Real projects beat theory
 🔹 DevOps is not just tools – it’s culture, automation, feedback, and monitoring
