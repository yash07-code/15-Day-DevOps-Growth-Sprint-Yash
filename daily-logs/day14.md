ðŸš€ Day 14/15 â€“ DevOps 15-Day Challenge: Mastering Observability with Prometheus & Grafana
As I approach the end of my DevOps sprint, todayâ€™s focus was on one of the most critical pillars of modern DevOps â€” Monitoring and Alerting 

ðŸ“Œ What I worked on today:
âœ… Deployed Prometheus using Helm charts in my AWS EKS cluster
 âœ… Integrated kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and custom service metrics
 âœ… Installed and configured Grafana to visualize Prometheus data
 âœ… Built real-time dashboards to monitor:
 ðŸ”¹ Node/Pod CPU & Memory usage
 ðŸ”¹ Deployment replica counts
 ðŸ”¹ HTTP response times & request throughput
 âœ… Connected Alertmanager to Prometheus to trigger alerts for abnormal conditions (like high memory usage or pod restarts)
 âœ… Setup basic email notification system to receive instant failure signals 

ðŸ”§ Why this matters:
 Monitoring is not just about pretty dashboards. It's about understanding the state of your system at any point in time, identifying anomalies before they become incidents, and creating a culture of proactive debugging.
 This step completes the feedback loop of CI/CD by providing live visibility into deployed applications.

ðŸŽ¯ Takeaway:
"You canâ€™t improve what you donâ€™t measure â€” observability is the silent hero of DevOps reliability."

ðŸ“… One final day to go. Iâ€™ll be wrapping up tomorrow with a full retrospective post â€” lessons learned, what went well, and whatâ€™s next!
Letâ€™s keep building, monitoring, and automating! ðŸ’ª
