ðŸš€ 11/15 â€“ DevOps Growth Sprint
Day 11: Mastering Helm â€“ The Package Manager for Kubernetes
1.Learned how Helm simplifies Kubernetes deployments using Charts
 2. Explored Helm architecture â€“ Charts, Templates, Values, Repositories
 3.Installed Helm and deployed a sample NGINX app on Kubernetes using a Helm chart
 4. Created custom values.yaml to override default settings
 5. Pushed and reused charts for consistent, versioned deployments

 What I Practiced:
helm install, helm upgrade, helm rollback
Built a Helm chart from scratch for a test app
Connected Helm with ArgoCD for GitOps-based Helm releases

ðŸ§  Why Helm Matters:
 Manual YAML is error-prone. Helm = reusable, parameterized, and production-grade Kubernetes config.
